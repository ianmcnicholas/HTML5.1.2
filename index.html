                    beforehand - pizza will comfort both the slob in you and the chef in you.<br>
                    Whether you want an easy "lob it in the oven" dinner, or want to have a fun date-night adding your
                    own toppings to home-made dough, a pizza will put a smile on your face anytime.</p>

                <summary>An easy, warming dish for a cold winter's day, a simple soup will sooth your cockles like
                    nothing else.</summary>

                    <figcaption>A traditional soup dish</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>As simple as chop, boil, blend, a soup is great way to get rid of leftover veggies, or experiment
                    with new ones. A world-dish means you can make it however you like.<br>
                    I remember the home-made soup my mother would make us on a cold day as a child, and now I can make
                    it myself, with just 3 ingredients. Simply delicious!</p>
